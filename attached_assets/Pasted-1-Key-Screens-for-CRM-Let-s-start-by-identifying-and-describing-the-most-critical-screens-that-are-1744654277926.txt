1. Key Screens for CRM
Let’s start by identifying and describing the most critical screens that are essential for understanding the CRM's functionality. We can break them down as follows:
1.1. Main Dashboard
•	Purpose: This is the central hub where law firm staff or Intakely users will see an overview of all activities. It gives them insights into lead status, client progress, billing summary, tasks, and AI agent performance.
•	Components:
o	Quick Access Links: Shortcuts to major modules (AI agent workflows, client management, billing, case statuses).
o	Performance Metrics: Visual reports on lead conversion, case progress, billing amounts, and AI agent success.
o	Alerts/Notifications: Displays any tasks that need attention, such as overdue billing, AI agent failures, or upcoming deadlines.
o	AI Agent Activity: A visual representation of the active AI agents and their task statuses.
1.2. Law Firm Profile & Customization Screen
•	Purpose: The setup screen where a law firm can define its profile, customize its CRM environment, and integrate services.
•	Components:
o	Firm Information: Editable fields for firm name, address, phone number, and primary contacts.
o	Service Selection: A section where the law firm can choose which AI services to activate (AI Intake, Billing, Document Generation, etc.).
o	Custom Workflow Setup: Drag-and-drop builder to adjust intake forms, document templates, and configure AI agents.
o	User Role Management: A part of the screen where admin users can define staff roles and access levels (e.g., Intake Manager, Admin, etc.).
1.3. AI Agent Configuration Interface
•	Purpose: This is where law firm admins or Intakely users configure the AI agents, customize prompts, and define their roles.
•	Components:
o	Agent Selection: A list of available AI agents (e.g., AI Intake Agent, AI Billing Agent), each of which can be activated or deactivated.
o	Customization Options: Customizable settings for each agent (e.g., intake questions for AI Intake Specialist, billing reminder templates for AI Billing Agent).
o	Testing Interface: A test section where users can interact with the AI agent to preview how it responds to client inputs (e.g., a demo interaction with the AI Intake Agent).
o	Logs & Feedback: Access to past interactions, performance logs, and feedback metrics to help improve the agents.
1.4. Client Management Screen
•	Purpose: The core screen where client profiles, case details, and communications are managed.
•	Components:
o	Client Overview: Summary of client’s details, active cases, and status.
o	Case Timeline: A visual representation of case progression, including important dates and milestones.
o	Communication Logs: Displays all interactions (phone, chat, email) with clients and leads.
o	Document Management: Ability to upload, view, and share documents related to the client’s cases (contracts, evidence, case files).
o	Task List: Tracks ongoing tasks related to the client (e.g., consultations, follow-ups, case reviews).
1.5. Task Management & Workflow Builder
•	Purpose: A dynamic workspace where users can assign and track tasks, automate workflows, and manage team assignments.
•	Components:
o	Task List: Shows tasks assigned to each team member, due dates, priority, and status (e.g., Pending, Completed, In Progress).
o	Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder: Allows users to create new workflows or modify existing ones by dragging actions, tasks, and conditions into place.
o	AI Task Automation: Automates repetitive tasks (e.g., sending follow-up emails, generating invoices) based on pre-configured workflows.
1.6. Reporting & Analytics Dashboard
•	Purpose: Provides in-depth insights into client and case performance, as well as AI agent effectiveness.
•	Components:
o	KPI Tracking: Displays key metrics such as client conversion rate, average case duration, and AI agent performance.
o	Custom Reports: Enables law firms to create custom reports based on data like client feedback, task completion, and billing.
o	Data Export Options: Allows users to export reports to CSV, PDF, or other formats for external analysis.

2. User Flows
Now, let's focus on the primary user flows. These are the steps users will follow to complete tasks within the CRM. For example:
2.1. Law Firm Onboarding Flow
•	Step 1: Law firm admin logs into the CRM.
•	Step 2: The admin sets up the firm’s profile (name, address, logo, etc.).
•	Step 3: The admin selects and configures the desired AI agents (e.g., AI Intake, AI Billing).
•	Step 4: The admin customizes the workflows (e.g., intake forms, practice area questions).
•	Step 5: Law firm staff are added to the system, and roles are assigned (e.g., Lawyer, Paralegal, Admin).
•	Step 6: The system provides a demo workflow (e.g., AI Intake Specialist) to allow the admin to test the setup.
•	Step 7: The admin finalizes the setup and the system starts automating processes (client intake, billing, etc.).
2.2. Client Intake Flow
•	Step 1: Client (John Doe) contacts the firm via the website, phone, or social media.
•	Step 2: The AI Intake Agent gathers John’s information (e.g., name, case type, contact details).
•	Step 3: The AI maps the case to the appropriate practice area (e.g., Family Law).
•	Step 4: AI Agent schedules an appointment with the appropriate attorney.
•	Step 5: John receives a confirmation message with appointment details via email or SMS.
•	Step 6: The AI creates a case record and assigns the relevant tasks to law firm staff (e.g., paralegal reviews intake).
2.3. AI Workflow Interaction
•	Step 1: Admin opens the AI Workflow Configuration screen.
•	Step 2: The admin selects an AI agent (e.g., AI Billing Agent) and customizes its settings (e.g., billing reminders, invoice generation).
•	Step 3: Admin sets up automation rules (e.g., send reminder emails 3 days before payment due date).
•	Step 4: Admin tests the workflow to ensure it functions as intended (e.g., AI generates an invoice, sends reminder).
•	Step 5: The workflow is finalized, and the system starts running tasks automatically.

3. High-Level Overview of UI/UX Design
•	Layout:
o	Header: Contains logo, navigation, user profile settings, and notifications.
o	Sidebar Menu: Provides quick links to key sections (e.g., AI Agent Management, Law Firm Management, Reports, Tasks).
o	Main Content Area: Displays detailed data views, forms, and action buttons.
o	Footer: Includes additional links like terms of service, privacy policy, etc.
•	Navigation:
o	Users will navigate through different sections using the sidebar menu.
o	The dashboard will serve as the landing page for both internal users and law firm users.
o	Workflow builders and AI agent customization screens should be interactive, supporting drag-and-drop functionality.

4. Simplified Diagrams & Wireframes
If possible, you could create wireframes or flow diagrams for these screens. These diagrams would highlight how users move through the system, what actions are available at each step, and how different components (e.g., client profiles, tasks, AI agents) are interconnected.
