The Intakely Legal AI Agentic CRM employs a multi-level navigation system designed to provide intuitive access to all platform features while maintaining a clean, organized interface. The navigation is structured into three primary levels:
Primary Navigation (Main Menu) - The leftmost sidebar providing access to core platform areas
Secondary Navigation (Law Firm Menu) - Context-specific navigation that appears when a law firm is selected
Tertiary Navigation (Expandable Sections) - Deeper navigation options that appear when expanding menu items
1. Primary Navigation (Main Menu)
The main navigation sidebar serves as the entry point to all major platform sections.
