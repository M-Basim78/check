### Navigation Structure - Architectural Document

## Overview

The Intakely Legal AI Agentic CRM employs a multi-level navigation system designed to provide intuitive access to all platform features while maintaining a clean, organized interface. The navigation is structured into three primary levels:

1. **Primary Navigation (Main Menu)** - The leftmost sidebar providing access to core platform areas
2. **Secondary Navigation (Law Firm Menu)** - Context-specific navigation that appears when a law firm is selected
3. **Tertiary Navigation (Expandable Sections)** - Deeper navigation options that appear when expanding menu items

## Navigation Behavior

### Interaction Patterns

1. **Collapsible Main Menu**: The primary navigation can be collapsed to a narrow icon bar to maximize workspace.
2. **Context-Sensitive Secondary Menu**: The law firm menu appears only when a firm is selected.
3. **Expandable Sections**: Menu items with children can be expanded/collapsed to show/hide deeper navigation options.
4. **Tooltips**: When the main menu is collapsed, tooltips appear on hover to identify icons.
5. **Visual Indicators**: Active and expanded items receive visual highlighting.
6. **Badges**: Notification counts appear as badges on relevant menu items.


### State Management

The navigation system maintains several states:

- Expanded/collapsed state of the main menu
- Currently expanded section in the main menu
- Selected law firm (triggering the secondary menu)
- Expanded sections within the secondary menu


## Technical Implementation

The navigation is implemented using React components with the following structure:

1. **MainNavigation**: Primary sidebar component (`components/main-navigation.tsx`)
2. **LawFirmNavigation**: Secondary sidebar component (`components/law-firm-navigation.tsx`)
3. **ClientLayout**: Layout component that orchestrates the navigation components (`app/ClientLayout.tsx`)


The navigation uses a combination of Next.js Link components for direct navigation and button elements for expandable sections. State is managed using React's useState hooks.

## Design Considerations

1. **Scalability**: The menu structure can accommodate additional items as the platform grows.
2. **Discoverability**: Features are organized logically to ensure users can find what they need.
3. **Context**: The secondary menu provides firm-specific context without cluttering the main interface.
4. **Efficiency**: Collapsible menus and expandable sections allow for efficient use of screen space.
5. **Consistency**: Visual styling and interaction patterns are consistent across all navigation levels.


## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the navigation structure include:

1. **Customizable Menus**: Allow users to pin frequently used items or customize menu order.
2. **Search Integration**: Add global search functionality across all navigation items.
3. **Role-Based Navigation**: Show/hide menu items based on user permissions.
4. **Navigation History**: Track and provide quick access to recently visited sections.
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement keyboard navigation for power users.
