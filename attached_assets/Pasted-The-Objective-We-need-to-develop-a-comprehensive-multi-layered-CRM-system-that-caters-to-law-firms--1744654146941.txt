The Objective: We need to develop a comprehensive multi-layered CRM system that caters to law firms and integrates AI-driven functionalities to automate lead intake, client management, case handling, billing, document generation, and reporting for solo and small law firms. The CRM should be layered into three CRM sections or categories, The first one layer/section/category being that the Intakely’s AI Agent Builder CRM which will leverage multiple AI agents for different tasks, orchestrated by a master agent in the form of templated workflows, so for example AI Intake Agent will be one such template. The second layer/section/category being the Intakely internal operations of setting up, managing and monitoring a Law Firm CRM.  While the last one will be just an extension of the second layer/section/category as a CRM provided for inputting voice messages instructions and updates to each relevant part of the CRM based on the service subscribed by the law firm. The system should be scalable, multi-tenant, and capable of managing both client-facing interactions and internal team operations. The following details will guide you to understand the screeenshots divided into layers.
________________________________________
1. Main Menu
•	Purpose: The main menu will serve as the central navigation hub for users, allowing them to quickly access different sections of the CRM.
o	Sections: Law Firm Management, AI Agent Workflow Builder, Client Engagement, Billing, Analytics, Notifications, and Support.
o	Actionable Links: Each section will be a clickable link that leads users to the specific workflows or tools (e.g., managing law firm profiles, customizing AI agents, running reports).
________________________________________
2. Side Menu for Internal Layers of the CRM
•	Purpose: For internal users (e.g., customer success agents, admin), the side menu will give quick access to more specific tools for managing internal operations and multi-tenancy settings.
o	Sections: User Management, Lead Tracking, Workflow Management, Task Management, Client Reports, Billing Insights, etc.
o	Functionality: These menus should allow the user to quickly switch between different internal functions, offering deep control over workflows, task assignments, AI agent management, and subscription settings.

3. Main Working and Input Window (for Client and Task Management)
•	Purpose: The central working window will be the area where tasks, client data, and case files are managed and interacted with.
o	Features:
	Client Dashboard: A detailed view of a client’s status, case progress, billing, and communication history.
	Interactive Tables: Use tables to manage clients, cases, and invoices, with inline editing capabilities and easy-to-read summaries.
	Activity Feed: Log of recent activities, AI updates, and system messages.
	Quick Action Buttons: Options for creating new tasks, assigning agents, or updating case statuses.

4. AI Agent Template Library and Workflow Builder
•	Purpose: This section will allow users to access pre-built AI agent templates (e.g., AI Intake Specialist) and create or modify workflows through a drag-and-drop builder.
o	Features:
	Template Library: A selection of predefined workflows and tasks for common legal CRM functions (e.g., intake, billing, client management).
	Drag-and-Drop Builder: A visual interface to design and modify workflows. Users should be able to configure steps, add conditions, and assign specific agents.
	Custom Prompts: Integrate a space to modify AI prompts based on law firm needs (e.g., custom intake questions or document templates).
	Snapshot Importing: Law firms should be able to import AI-driven workflow templates or "snapshots" from Intakely’s library.
________________________________________
5. AI Voice Agent Configuration
•	Purpose: This section will allow for configuring voice agents that interact with clients.
o	Features:
	Voice Settings: Options for selecting AI voices, customizing tone, and adjusting speech styles (e.g., formal, friendly).
	Voice Workflow Integration: Connects the voice agents to workflows (e.g., lead qualification, appointment scheduling) to ensure seamless task delegation.
	Interaction Logs: Logs for tracking voice commands, responses, and progress to ensure AI is functioning as expected.

How This Affects Intakely’s AI Agentic Legal CRM Setup
•	Modular Layout: The design should allow users to interact with different layers of the CRM seamlessly (e.g., switching between law firm management, client interaction, task tracking).
•	Voice Agent Integration: Firebase should be configured to handle voice agent interactions, storing commands, responses, and associated task logs.
•	Workflow Flexibility: Ensure that workflows can be built, modified, and stored within Firebase Firestore, making them easily accessible to users for configuration.
•	Real-Time Data Sync: Given Firebase’s real-time capabilities, ensure that user actions (e.g., creating new clients, updating cases) are reflected instantly across all connected devices.

Next Steps:
1.	Finalize the User Interface (UI): Based on the given designs, we’ll need to ensure to supports dynamic, interactive elements (e.g., drag-and-drop workflow builder, real-time updates).
2.	Integrate AI Workflows: Create pre-built workflows that law firms can easily import and modify, making sure these workflows are linked to the backend systems for real-time processing.
3.	Voice Agent Setup: Implement the necessary components to handle voice interactions, ensuring that voice commands trigger the correct tasks and updates within the CRM.
4.	Testing & Iteration: Ensure the user experience matches expectations by running multiple tests (especially for the workflow builder, voice integrations, and task management features).
